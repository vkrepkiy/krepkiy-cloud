  JS + CSS animation
</h2>
<p>
  Disclaimer: DOM should never be used to visualize huge amount of objects,
  especially animated ones!
</p>
<p>
  Flying tags. CSS have no random() function (though SASS has static random
  generator), so we need to update CSS values in JS code. The main concept is
  "calculate less, render more" without quality issues. The solution is great
  for displaying small amount of animated objects on slow clients.
