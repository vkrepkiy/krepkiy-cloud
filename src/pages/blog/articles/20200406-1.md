## The goal

Try building modern SPA without 3-d party libs

## Time spent

2 days

## Current status

App is still in progress and not ready for production.

## Details

I've completed the following:

- Component decorator
  - web-component factory with shadow dom
  - no data binding or template syntax ðŸ˜©
- Router
- lazy-loading ðŸŽ‰
- router-outlet component has bad design and usability ðŸ˜”
- Singleton
  - too much limitations
- Application bootstrap
  - small page size
  - and a few codebase (I should keep it that way)
  - results in fast loading ðŸ‘Œ
  - seamless app loading requires code duplication, it should be solved at code bundling stage

The problems I've struggled:

- abstract aim, I still have no ideas
- no requirements, too much refactoring
- no 3d party libs, huge time consumption to write your own

## Conclusion

- Use available 3-d party libs
- Make graphic design or scetch before coding
- I should write more comments in source code with explanation why I've done things this way
- I should make much less refactoring

## Next goal

Use scrum (?) methodology. Set time limit, set goal and write next report when time is out.
Features to do:

- [high priority] blog should be accessible
